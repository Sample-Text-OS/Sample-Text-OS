<h1>What is it?</h1>

#### Sample Text OS is a new modification of Windows, similar to [Atlas OS](https://github.com/Atlas-OS/Atlas) and [Revi OS](https://github.com/meetrevision/playbook). Instead of being made for consumer versions of Windows, like Windows 11 Pro, it is made for Windows Server versions. The goal is to modify Windows Server to be optimized for desktop users. As you can see, graphic design is my passion.

<h1>What it's made for.</h1>

#### This playbook is designed to work with the 2 latest Windows Server versions:
[Windows Server 2022](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/download-windows-server-2022)

[Windows Server 2025 Preview](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/download-windows-server-2025)
