<h1>What is it?</h1>

#### Sample Text OS is a new modification of Windows, similar to [Atlas OS](https://github.com/Atlas-OS/Atlas) and [Revi OS](https://github.com/meetrevision/playbook). Instead of being made for consumer versions of Windows, like Windows 11 Pro, it is made for Windows Server versions. The goal is to modify Windows Server to be optimized for desktop users. As you can see, graphic design is my passion.

<h1>What it's made for.</h1>

#### This playbook is designed to work with the 2 latest Windows Server versions:
[Windows Server 2022](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/download-windows-server-2022)

[Windows Server 2025 Preview](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/download-windows-server-2025)

#### I don't intend to support older versions of Windows Server, since they have compatability issues with some software.

<h1>The goal.</h1>

#### The goal is to create a very minimal, yet polished experience for desktop users. Because it's based on a stable version of Windows, it will remain reliable for many years, without worrying about an update changing your system with features that you didn't ask for. There's still a lot to implement into this playbook, and I want to make this happen!
